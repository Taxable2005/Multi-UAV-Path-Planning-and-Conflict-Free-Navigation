# Multi-UAV Path Planning and Conflict-Free Navigation

This repository contains a project on **multi-UAV path planning and conflict-free navigation**, focused on enabling multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to operate safely and efficiently within a shared environment. The project addresses trajectory planning, coordination, and collision avoidance among multiple autonomous agents.

---

## Overview

The objective of this project is to study and implement strategies for coordinating multiple UAVs such that each vehicle reaches its destination while avoiding conflicts with other UAVs. The work emphasizes safe navigation, efficient path generation, and decentralized or centralized decision-making mechanisms for multi-agent systems.

The project models UAVs as autonomous agents operating in a common airspace, where conflicts such as collisions or path intersections must be detected and resolved in real time or during the planning phase.

## Key Features

- Multi-agent UAV navigation in a shared environment  
- Path planning for multiple UAVs with individual start and goal locations  
- Conflict detection and avoidance between UAV trajectories  
- Coordinated motion to ensure collision-free navigation  
- Simulation-based evaluation of UAV paths and interactions

## Path Planning and Conflict Resolution

The system focuses on generating feasible paths for each UAV while ensuring that no two UAVs violate safety constraints during flight. Conflict-free navigation is achieved by incorporating coordination mechanisms that account for the positions, velocities, and planned trajectories of neighboring UAVs.

The approach highlights key challenges in multi-UAV systems, including scalability, coordination complexity, and safe operation in constrained environments.
